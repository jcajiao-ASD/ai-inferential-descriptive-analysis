### About SonarQube

SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource that continuously inspects code quality.
It performs static code analysis to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your source code,
while also measuring metrics like duplications, complexity, and test coverage. This helps teams maintain
high-quality, secure, and maintainable code over time.
